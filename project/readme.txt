1. run a file

2. the program is iterative, it will run for total 8 updates. 

3. new admission can take place only at 0th and 4th update only. At 0th update roll nos. will be given as 13MS and for the 4th update as 14MS.

4. after every admission a textline will be printed in a file named "MOTHER.txt" in order to help arnab and spandan with their programme.

5. a student(only for who took admission at the 0th update) completes its degree at the end of 8th update.

6. after every 2 updates a new semester will start.

7. make sure to enter grades for previous semester before registering for the next semester.

8. there is a "delete1" subroutine which will read from file named "MOTHER.txt" and will remove those lines in which there is a marker to delete a particular student and also the student will be deleted from my database.

9. if a student fails in any of the courses, I will put 1(as a marker that a student got failed) in the last column in the text file with the help of subroutine named "mark_failed". If a student got passed in his backlog courses in the next semester a ) marker will be entered in the file with the help of subroutine named "mark_unfailed". Spandan will then stop/start the stipend for that student. 

10. A student will not get degree if he has any dues and accordingly the message will be printed.

11. Grades that can be given are  A+, A, B+, B, C, D, F. Grades are case sensitive. If enetred wrong grades then that will be considered as 0 points.s

12. If you will try to register for non existing student or who was registered but deleted later due to some reasons, a message will be send accodingly.
